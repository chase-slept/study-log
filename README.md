## Acknowledgment

This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), using the [Astro Cactus theme](https://astro-cactus.chriswilliams.dev/), forked from [here](https://github.com/chrismwilliams/astro-theme-cactus). Make sure to check out those projects for more information.

## About The Project

For this project, I wanted to use a static site generator to quickly build a website that would be easy to update with new content in the future. In a previous project I used Jekyll, but to avoid the comfort of reusing existing project files, I decided to try a completely different tool. I saw a lot of recommendations for Astro, and after browsing the available themes I decided to use Astro Cactus as a template. The theme is well documented and was easy to understand and get up-and-running, which was the main goal.

## Secondary Goals

In addition to the main goals (quick to stand-up, easy to add content), I wanted to accomplish some other goals along the way:

- Practice AWS concepts (S3, IAM)
- Practice Github Actions (CI/CD)

## To Do

- ~~Create Github Issues for each of the following to-do items:~~
- Modify existing pages to suit my needs
  - About
  - Home / Index
  - Blog / Posts (start with deleting template posts)
- ~~Configure DNS (Cloudflare) A Record to new host (AWS)~~
- Enable Cloudflare Cache Purge in deploy action
- ~~Add links between main website and this website~~
