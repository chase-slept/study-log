## What I've Been Studying

Since this log begins in the middle of study, here's a quick recap:

I'm currently studying AWS concepts in preparation for the Solutions Architect Associate certification. Before this, I went through the study guide and coursework (Stephane Maarek on Udemy; A Cloud Guru) for the Cloud Practitioner foundational certification, since I knew very little about the cloud and fundamental cloud concepts.

The last chapter I studied was on Route 53, a DNS service from AWS. The current chapter is on ELB (Elastic Load Balancing). Some other concepts I've studied so far:

    - Shared Responsibility Model
    - Well-Architected Framework
    - IAM (Identity and Access Management)
    - S3 (Simple Storage Service)
    - EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
    - EBS (Elastic Block Storage)
    - EFS (Elastic File System) & FSx
    - Database services (RDS, DynamoDB, etc.)
    - VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Networking

## When and How I Study

Typically I study in 1-2 hour blocks during the day, but I also review video content whenever I have free time throughout the day (like when driving for work or errands). My method for learning new things usually involves immersing myself as much as possible in the topic; I'll watch/listen to training courses, tutorials, or walkthroughs on Youtube or Udemy or ACG, read books/articles about those topics, think about the topics I'm studying, and review what I've learned to figure out where I lack understanding so I know where to continue to focus my efforts.

Immersion is great and I find it helps a lot to get my head around the ideas and to see how others think about them, but the real progress comes from implementing projects hands-on. This website is a perfect example---I already have a blog for projects, so I didn't really need a *second* blog. This gave me a great opportunity to use AWS services I had learned about already. I used IAM to set up an identity for my Github Action to build this site onto an S3 instance, which is where the website files are hosted. Hosting a simple static website is a pretty common use for S3 and it was pretty easy to implement, but *actually doing it* gave me real experience and validated the concepts I'd been learning--it made it **real**.

Anyway, that's it for now. Going forward, these posts will likely be less structured and more freeform note-taking.
